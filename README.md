  <h1> Hi there, welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
  
  I am Carlos, I have over seven years of experience in software development and data, primarily in consultancy, logistics, and mobility. 

I am passionate about solving complex business problems, including collecting, interpreting, analyzing, and modeling data. I also like learning about management and new technologies focused on Machine Learning, MLOps, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. 

  - Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (Machine Learning).
  - I'm looking to collaborate on data science and data engineering projects.
  - I also teach computer science topics such as Python, OOP, Unit and Integration Testing with Pytest, Packaging with Python, API REST, Software Engineering, Monitoring, Observability, Docker, and GitHub Actions.
  - Ask me about data engineering topics (SQL, ETL, orchestration, Spark, streaming, batch, etc).
  
  <br>
 ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning topics oriented to Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
